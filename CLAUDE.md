# CLAUDE.md — MarginSheet™
## The constitution. Read before every task. If a task contradicts this file, stop and ask Guy.

MarginSheet is a premium household financial operating system: an AI bookkeeper (MyKeeper™) and an AI CFO (MyCFO™) keep a household's books and watch the month ahead. The core is three things: the brains, the MarginSheet (actuals + projections), and Cash Flow. The product is a belief system — The Margin Method™ — and features are downstream of doctrine.

## Authority hierarchy (when documents disagree)

1. Guy's live rulings in conversation
2. `conversation-service-spec.md` + `mycfo-mykeeper-conversational-spec.md` (all of Phase B)
3. The Margin Method / Manifesto (doctrine, vocabulary, posture)
4. The eight Phase A specs (below)
5. Base44 code (historical reference only; it is being decommissioned)

## The spec map

## Build discipline (non-negotiable)

- **One module at a time. Never stacked.** Tests green before the next module opens.
- **Every task plan is drafted for Guy's approval before execution.** No unapproved scope.
- **Verify against the database directly, never against reports.** Reports lie, data doesn't.
- Each spec's invariants section seeds that module's test suite. An invariant without a test is not done.
- Golden tests and the lint layer block merges in CI. No prompt version ships failing either.
- The advice gate is live before the first real message ever sends, and it never fails open.
- Scope creep toward parked items (Module 8 Balance Sheet, Module 11 build, shared learning networks, early-activation offer) is refused by default; "while we're in there" is a 2027 phrase.

## Stack (locked)

Cloudflare Workers + Pages · Neon Postgres (single DB, branching in CI) · Durable Objects (per-household lock) · Queues + Cron · R2 · Better Auth (passwordless: passkey + magic link; phone = security primitive via Twilio Verify) · Plaid production (Sandbox for CI only) · Stripe · Twilio (two A2P numbers, one per brain) · Postmark (brains' email) · Kit (commercial voice only) · Sentry · PostHog · GitHub Actions.

**Model routing** (fallback chains, golden-tested per chain member):
- High-stakes composition (close, Briefing, verdict-flip corrections): Fable 5 → Sonnet 5 → **stop and queue**
- Routine composition: Fable 5 → Sonnet 5 (flagged)
- Time-critical alerts: Fable 5 → Sonnet 5 → canonical fixture
- Advice-gate judge: Sonnet 5 → Haiku 4.5 → **no send, ever**
- Parsing/extraction/merchant lookup: Haiku 4.5 → Sonnet 5
- The composer never computes; every number traces to a fact-package field or it is a hard failure.

## Vocabulary and format (locked; lint-enforced)

- Dollar result = **Kept** (negative = **Overspent**). Percentage = **Margin**, always the % symbol.
- Negative Margin in parentheses: (6%). Positive figures never take parentheses. Overspent renders as a positive figure and is never behavioral commentary.
- **No em dashes anywhere**, in any output, code comments included.
- "budgeting apps" always in quotation marks. "Commandments" banned. Numerals for day counts ("the first 14 days").
- ™ on first/prominent use: MarginSheet™, The Margin Method™, MyKeeper™, MyCFO™. "AI" never appended to the marks.
- P&L lines: income, fixed_obligations, variable_operating, discretionary, interest_fees, transfer, deployment. Taxes is a category ("Taxes After Takehome") under fixed_obligations, **not a line**.
- Banned in analytical replies: "should," "need to," "afford," "cut" (as instruction), "recommend," affordability verdicts, "delta/variance/discrepancy" in corrections, "again/still haven't/reminder" in follow-up alerts, "good call"/"that cost you" on decisions.

## Product doctrine (the short form)

- Income − Spending = Kept. The trial is 14 days, card required. Annual Planning Session is included with every subscription; the clean-books gate is eligibility, never price.
- Unconfirmed inflows count as income, labeled, with the transparency counterfactual shown. Transfers are neither. Refunds net against spending. Reimbursements are AR. Gifts are income, filed by asking.
- The brains state facts and costs; they never name actions with money. Meanings are asked, never asserted. Estimates are sourced or asked, never invented. Model memory is banned as a source for current figures.
- Commercial voice (billing, offers, dunning) is MarginSheet through Kit — never a brain.
- The app is the inspection room, not the workroom. Nothing chases the household.
- Corrections: fix the books first, own it in one flat sentence, never silently revise a sent artifact.

## NET WORTH DOCTRINE (locked August 2026)

MarginSheet's promise is control, and the opportunity to create wealth. It never promises wealth outcomes. The causal chain in all copy and all product language is: control, then opportunity, then wealth. Only the first is promised.

1. Net worth is never a hero metric. It is never the largest number on a screen, never the lead figure in a digest, never the opening line of any composed deliverable.
2. Net worth is never celebrated. No congratulations, no milestones, no streaks, no achievement framing, from either brain, in any channel, ever. The brains do not have opinions about the size of a household's net worth in either direction.
3. The Module 8 Balance Sheet reports position ("where you stand") without scoring it. Net worth may appear as a computed line on the Balance Sheet. It is information, not evaluation.
4. Margin is the only celebrated number, because Margin is the only number the household controls. Net worth moves with markets and estimates; Margin moves only with household decisions.
5. Rationale for reviewers: a net-worth-led product flatters the user about assets the same way a moralizing product lectures the user about debts. Both are the tool having opinions about the person. MarginSheet is an instrument. It sees everything and judges nothing.

Rules 1 and 2 are enforced by `packages/lint` (`no-net-worth-lead`, `no-net-worth-celebration`), the same engine that gates commits today and M11's send path in October. Rule 1's "largest number on a screen" clause is a design review item, not lint-detectable; see the rules file.

## Current state (updated 14 Aug 2026)

Spec phase complete (8/8 + 2 brain docs). Targets: **1 Oct stretch** (platform, founder migrated), **1 Nov real** (founder fully live), beta cohort gated on founder OK + objective floor (zero advice-gate hard failures, zero traceability failures, trailing 14 days). M0 opens next. External clocks: A2P 10DLC submission, cyber liability quotes, attorney hour (8 items) — Guy's desk.
